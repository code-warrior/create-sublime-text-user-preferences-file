# Create Sublime Text User Preferences File

(v0.0.51)

This project is an online tool that generates a preferences file for use with Sublime Text 3. It explains fifty-one of the 101 options Sublime supplies in the JSON-formatted file `Preferences.sublime-settings` and creates a downloadable user-generated file that can be included in a Sublime environment. The goal is to explain all 101 options.

The project lives at [http://www.create-sublime-text-user-preferences-file.org](http://www.create-sublime-text-user-preferences-file.org).
