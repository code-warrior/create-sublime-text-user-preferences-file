# Create Sublime Text User Preferences File

(v0.0.11)

This project is an online tool that generates a preferences file for use with Sublime Text 3. It explains each of the 101 options Sublime supplies in the JSON-formatted file `Preferences.sublime-settings` and creates a downloadable user-generated file that can be included in a Sublime environment.

_This project is in the alpha phase, because only thirty-six of the 101 options have been implemented._

The project lives at [http://www.create-sublime-text-user-preferences-file.org](http://www.create-sublime-text-user-preferences-file.org).

## Get Involved/Participate

Like many open source projects, this project was begun by a single person. Consequently, the continued development will likely be slow-going.
