         <h2>Auto Indent</h2>
         <div>
            <p><code>"auto_indent": <span> </span>,</code></p>
            <p>When <code>auto_indent</code> is enabled, pressing the return key aligns the cursor at the current level of indentation. For example, if you were working in a block of text that was indented by 9 spaces and then pressed the return key, the cursor would align at 9 spaces on the next line, saving you the trouble of having to hit the space bar 9 times to align the next block of content. If this option were disabled (<code>false</code>), pressing the return key would place the cursor at the beginning of the line.</p>

            <p>This option works closely with <code><a href="#smart_indent">smart_indent</a></code>, <code><a href="#trim_automatic_white_space">trim_automatic_white_space</a></code>, and <code><a href="#indent_to_bracket">indent_to_bracket</a></code>. <span class="pending">An explanation of their inter-relation is pending.</span></p>
