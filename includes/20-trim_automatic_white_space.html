         <h2>Trim Automatic White Space</h2>
         <div>
            <p><code>"trim_automatic_white_space": <span> </span>,</code></p>
            <p>This option removes white space that appears on a line by itself. It’s usually added by mistake, and is hard to see because it’s white space. Let’s look at an example:</p>
<pre>&lt;p&gt;This is the first paragraph…&lt;/p&gt;
<span class="highlight">&sdot;&sdot;&sdot;</span>
&lt;p&gt;and this is the second one.&lt;/p&gt;</pre>
            <p>The three highlighted dots between the paragraphs represent three spaces that were mistakenly included in the document. Enabling <code>trim_automatic_white_space</code> would automatically delete it when you hit the return key.</p>
            <p><strong>Note</strong>: if you open a file that already has white space on one or more lines, it won’t delete the existing white space, but won’t add to it, either, when you hit return key.</p>
