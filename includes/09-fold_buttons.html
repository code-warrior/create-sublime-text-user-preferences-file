            <p>Perhaps better referred to as fold “triangles,” fold buttons are small, direction-pointing triangles drawn in the gutter that indicate whether a block — or region — of text can be collapsed. Clicking a fold button in the gutter collapses a balanced region of text, much like pressing down on an accordion hides its bellows.</p>
            <p><strong>Note</strong>: If line numbers are showing in the gutter (<code><a href="#line_numbers">"line_numbers"</a>: true</code>), then the buttons are drawn to the right of the line numbers.</p>
