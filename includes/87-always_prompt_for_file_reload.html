            <p>If a file that’s being edited by Sublime is modified by another program, the user is notified that the file has “changed on disk” and asks whether she/he would like to “reload it.” For example, imagine you’re editing a file called “index.html” with Sublime. Later on, you start editing the file with TextWrangler, forgetting that it’s already open in Sublime (because you have many files open).</p>
            <p>You then switch over to Sublime, which will prompt you, as discussed earlier, to reload the file. If this option were disabled, Sublime would reload “index.html,” complete with changes made by TextWrangler, without your knowledge.</p>
