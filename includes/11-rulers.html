            <p>This option creates vertical lines — or rulers — to help you to see indentation and margins. You may have one or more rulers, and the default is to leave this option empty, which yields no ruler at all.</p>
            <p>Some pre-defined rulers are listed below, or you can edit the resulting file to include your own rulers.</p>
