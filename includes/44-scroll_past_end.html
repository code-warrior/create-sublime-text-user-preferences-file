         <div>
            <p><code>"scroll_past_end": <span> </span>,</code></p>
            <p>Instead of aligning the bottom of your file with the bottom of the window, this option appends “virtual” white space at the end of your file so the content at the bottom can scroll up, making the lower portion of your document easier to read. The white space added at the bottom is virtual because it’s not part of the file; it’s only present in order to allow you to scroll up.</p>
            <p>IntelliJ, WebStorm, PhpStorm and other JetBrains products call this option “Show virtual space at file bottom.”</p>
