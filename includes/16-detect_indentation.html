            <p>Upon load of a document, Sublime Text performs an analysis of white space, setting the options <code>tab_size</code> and <code>translate_tabs_to_spaces</code>. This is useful when wanting to retain the format of an existing file. For example, you have tabs being interpreted as spaces, and each tab is converted to 3 spaces, but you work temporarily on a file that only has tabs that are 4 spaces wide.</p>
            <p>You might turn this option off if you were refactoring a messy code base to your standards, or if you wanted to make sure that <em>all</em> your source code was formatted exactly as you intended.</p>
